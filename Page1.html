        <h1>The Silencer Help</h1>
        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <p>Movement by default in <em>The Silencer</em> is done by swiping the screen, pulling the map in the opposite direction of the direction you wish to go. As North is up, to move east you swipe left, to move west right, to go north you swipe down, and to go south you swipe up. Movement can be inverted in Settings so that you pull the player in the direction you want to move, and as a development feature you can hold down on the screen to force a move to the east â€” moving through anything, including trees, deep water, and void tiles.</p>
        <p>Each game chunk in <em>The Silencer</em> contains 576 tiles in a 24 by 24 tile grid. Moving to the edge of the chunks will load another chunk. If you recieve placeholder text when entering a game chunk and you seem to be in the same chunk you just left, try going back the way you came: you may have walked off the map. Chunk-to-chunk movement can also be achieved by going through an underground entrance.</p>
        <p>None of the tiles in <em>The Silencer</em> will hurt you, but beware crossbow bolts and arrows! Being hit by a bolt or arrow will result in an instant loss of the game, and you will lose all of your progress.</p>
        <p>Speed can be adjusted using the segmented control bar in the top right corner of the screen. 1x or 2x speed is best for navigation or exploration, but if you want to get somewhere quickly you can use 4x speed and cover a game chunk in only twelve swipes!</p>
