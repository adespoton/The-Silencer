        <h1>The Silencer Help</h1>
        <h2>In-Game Jobs</h2>
        <p>A variety of jobs are explained in <em>The Silencer</em>. However, the player never has the opportunity to actually earn money, and jobs are done for no benefit to the player in mission threads. For those who are interested, some jobs available in the SilencedLands will give an explanation of the quality of life. Here the symbol "$" refers to crowns, and "¢" to pennycrowns. There are 100 pennycrowns in a crown. Extreme poverty has faced the Silenced Lands by this point, with the cost of living being a good deal higher than the average wages. As a result, most people who were not in a military organization ended up eating two small meals a day and being undernourished, leading to a need for younger and older people being employed in the civilian workforce. </p>
