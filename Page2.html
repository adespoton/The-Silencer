        <h1>The Silencer Help</h1>
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>Many of the settings in <em>The Silencer</em> are experimental and some do not work well with each other. For example, reloading the game after adjusting tile size is recommended, as the player and NPCs will not move and could end up stuck.</p>
        <p>For ordinary gameplay, any settings in "Experimental Features" should not be changed from their defaults, but player size and maximum text size can be changed without any consequences. Control inversion can make for some interesting and less intuitive gameplay, but can be annoying and so is designed to be used only for people who want to make life difficult for themselves.</p>
        <p>The game can also be restarted using the "Restart Game on Next Launch" feature.</p>
